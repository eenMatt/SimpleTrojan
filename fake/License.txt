Software Usage

The product is "in use" on a computer when it is loaded into temporary memory (i.e. RAM) or installed into permanent memory (e.g. hard disk, CD-ROM, or other storage device) of that computer, except that a copy installed on a network server for the sole purpose of distribution to other computers is not "in use".
Single user license

A single user license is a license to a single user. This single user can use the product on any computer as long as the product is not in concurrent use on any other computer. i.e. you own two computers. You may have the product installed, but not have it running on more than one computer at a time. This "reasonable use" clause applies only to the single user license.
Multi computer license

You may install the production version of the product to any number of computers provided that this number does not exceed the limit set in the license file purchased by you. If you own a 2 computer license, you may not install the product on 3 computers, even if you are only using it on 2 computers concurrently.

Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties or liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you. This Limitation of Liability gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights, which vary, from state to state or country to country.
